# Kafka-Driven Microservices

## Overview
This project implements a microservices architecture using Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging. It demonstrates how to build scalable and resilient applications by leveraging Kafka's distributed messaging capabilities. The application consists of multiple microservices that communicate via Kafka topics, showcasing a real-world use case of event-driven architecture.

## Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each service operates independently, promoting scalability and maintainability.
- **Apache Kafka**: Used for reliable messaging between microservices, ensuring data is sent and received without loss.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used to develop the microservices, allowing rapid development and easy configuration.
- **Docker**: Containerization of services for easier deployment and management.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization of service metrics.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of the following components:
- **Service A**: Produces messages to a Kafka topic.
- **Service B**: Consumes messages from the Kafka topic and processes them.
- **Service C**: Listens for processed messages and performs additional actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Apache Kafka
- Docker (for containerization)
- Maven (for dependency management)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Avadhesh2/kafka-driven-microservices.git
   cd kafka-driven-microservices
   
Start Kafka using Docker:

docker-compose up -d

Build the project using Maven:
mvn clean install
Running the Application


Start each microservice:

cd service-a
mvn spring-boot:run


Open a new terminal for Service B and Service C:

cd service-b
mvn spring-boot:run

cd service-c
mvn spring-boot:run
Verify that the services are running and able to communicate via Kafka.

Usage
Send messages from Service A, and observe the processing in Service B and Service C.
Monitor application performance using Prometheus and visualize metrics in Grafana.
